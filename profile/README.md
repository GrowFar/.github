# Growfar

GROWFAR is a mobile application-based product that utilizes artificial intelligence to provide price recommendations, helps form horizontal integration between farmers and crowdsourcing, and increases the efficiency of worker management by automating job status updates. Concerning this, the product will be developed by implementing a geofencing and geospatial-based system. Adopting crowdsourcing as a medium to collect commodity selling price data from the surrounding farmer community will simplify and accelerate existing information distribution.
